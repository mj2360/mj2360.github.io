    On an early Autumn morning in Washington Square Park one could watch the leaves change and listen to the splash of the fountain, the coo of a pigeon, and dogs wagging their tails, all in the company of Greenwich Village’s early-risers. Outside of the early morning serenity is a rare commodity. Washington Square Park, a 10-acre greensward sandwiched between West 4th Street and Waverly Place, is one of New York’s most infamous parks. It is the heart of Greenwich Village, which has long been the breeding ground for well-to-do, influential New Yorkers.

        The park's history is almost as rich as the homeowners in the neighborhood. Before becoming a public park in 1826 the park was a potter’s field, where poor folks and black slaves were buried in unmarked graves. In 1826 the land was bought by New York’s mayor at the time, Phillip Hone, who used the area as a militia training site. Eventually fences were erected and greener grass was laid upon rotting bodies, and the park we know today began to come to life. The park was named for President George Washington. In 1889 to commemorate the centenary of his inauguration there was a three day long celebration, for which architect Stanford White was commissioned to create a paper-mache arch. After the celebration White was hired by the city to design a permanent marble version to stand on the North edge of the park.

            Standing on the south side of the 70 foot monument, you can look for miles down 5th Avenue stretching north of the park. This view may be the most iconic imagery of the park. Though the arch gets a lot of tourist attraction, Washington Square Park has so much more to offer, for New Yorkers and visitors alike. The park has a long history of being a safe haven for artists, performers, activists, demonstrators, religious-affiliates, and nearly every other subculture under the sun. There is this amazing ability for unconventional and creative energies to be nurtured and held by the space.

            People come from far and wide to witness the eccentric flavors of the park, listen to a local jazz band, browse artworks on display, or see the spectacle of a grand piano in a park. Although, some may not know how long of a journey it has been for street performers and musicians who frequent the park. Predecessors have had to fight hard for the freedom to express and share their art in the park. Namely in the 1960s when the bourgeois of Greenwich Village held a lot of disdain for the bohemian crowd and the beatnik folksingers.

            Back then one needed a permit if they wanted to gather in the park and play music. There was a Folk Center a few blocks away, on MacDougal Street, owned by a man named Izzy Young. This center was frequently visited by folk music legends like Bob Dylan. Young would often file for a permit with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation so amateurs and professionals alike could gather on Sunday’s to play together. But yuppie residents of the Village would frequently complain and petition against the folksinger, claiming they spread immorality and were a nuisance.

            One day when the Folk Center was denied a permit to sing in the park Young decided to organize a protest. So in 1961, thousands came to rally in Washington Square Park. Young claimed that it was “a peaceful demonstration asking for our rights” because “people had the right to sing.” But the protest quickly got out of hand and became infamously known as the Beatnik Riot. Street performers didn’t get the right to perform without a permit, until the late 1970s when the law around the permits was deemed to go against the First Amendment right to free speech. Though even then a lot of street performers and artists still ran the risk of getting arrested. There have been a number of court cases around the matter.

            And even now there street performers still face a risk of being arrested, although it is much less likely than it was back in those days. In Washington Square Park, NYPD and park police have a “hands-off” approach to policing the park, in order to keep the peace. Plus, the people of the park are pretty good at self policing.

            On a regular weekend the park is quite crowded. You can see all types of people: owners of little dogs, black women dressed as civil rights icons, white men wearing Trump masks, teens cruising on skateboards, punk-rock wannabes in dangerously high platforms, nannies with strollers, kind-hearted folks walking their old women. It is truly a people watchers paradise. And it’s nearly impossible to tune out the cacophony of sound. Instruments and human chatter blur together birthing a sort of melodic roar.
