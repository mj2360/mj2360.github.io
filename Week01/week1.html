            <p>Before watching this video I never thought about the impact of what you are seeing in the peripheral of your screen when looking at it. Berger brings the audiences awareness to this when talking about viewing reproductions of art. There is a major difference in viewing a piece in context of a frame, a museum wall, and other art works versus viewing a piece of art in the context of an environment that is more familiar to you (not in a museum). Most people do not think about this difference though. It makes me think about how much is going on in our minds subconsciously when we are seeing things. People may not actively think about every detail of seeing but every detail does matter. </p>

            <p>I have always known that seeing the textures in the detail of a painting is only possible when you are face to face with the original. I agree with Berger about the idea that there is something gained and lost in the technological reproduction of art. On one end that texture that you can pick up on when looking at a painting face to face is lost but what is gained is accessibility. I think that accessibility to things is much more important than the tiny details that you lose. Accessibility to art is a topic that I am personally very passionate about. Growing up I didn’t have the privilege of going to a lot of art museums with my family. And as I grew older and grew passionate for art and the viewing of art in museums I began to realize the sadness of the fact that I didn’t have access to such things as a child. And that brings me to the beauty of the internet. The internet makes all information, including art, accessible to a wider range of people around the world. Almost everyone has some level of access to the internet these days. </p>

            <p>There are many downsides to the ubiquity of screens and the web in our daily lives but there is also the magic of transmittable information that is made possible. Having information, in the form of text and images, being put into the context of people’s everyday lives is something I want to use in the context of my professional life. I want to transmit information in a way that is useful for the greater good and improves the quality of people’s everyday lives. </p>
