			<p>It is interesting to read Bush speculate about what the internet could be before the invention of the internet. I think his aspirations of a way to store information similarly to how the human mind store memories is way more scientific than <mark>the reality of what the internet is today.</mark> Bush had no way of imagining that <mark>the internet and the web could embody so much of human society and psychology.</mark> I think that is what made his article so boring to me. It was probably much more fascinating to people reading it in 1945 because there was nothing like what Bush was describing. </p>
			<br>
			<p>There is a huge difference in the way Bush communicates the possibilities of the Internet and the Web and the way Berners-Lee talks about the actuality of what his invention has become in todayâ€™s society. It is interesting to think about how limited Bushâ€™s view on the possibility of the internet was. Although he was thinking way ahead of his time he failed to perceive that an entirely new world could form through the Internet on the web. I found most interesting Berners-Leeâ€™s discussion on Electronic Human Rights. The fact that there is <mark>a whole new world created on the Web</mark> does make me believe that our definitions of human rights do need to be extended in a way that considers this world. </p>
			<br>
			<p>These human rights would be closely related to the rights we have over our data and the use of our data. A lot of people donâ€™t think about the way companies like Facebook are using the data that you allow them access to. Berners-Lee mentions the way that <mark>Facebook is monopolizing and fragmenting the Web with their centralizing platform.</mark> I agree with Berners-Lee that this is slightly problematic. What is even more problematic is how they share the attention that they gain from users with advertisers in order to monetize their platform. A lot of people arenâ€™t thinking about how their information is being used. They think that using social media networks is free however they are giving away their data. But it is difficult to make rules for the Web, on one hand it could be beneficial to protect people and on the other hand it can take away certain freedoms.	</p>
