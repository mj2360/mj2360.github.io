            <h2>The Poem </h2>
            <h1>"About Time" </h1>
            <p>Each day begins to crash, fade, and blur deeper into the next 
                <br>
                I crack my eyes open rising over crashing lake waves 
                <br>
               Wiping the sleep from my eyes waiting for the sun to set 
                <br>
               Waiting for the clock to tick and turn 
                <br>
               The seconds are audible burning holes through my ear canal and into my brain 
                <br>
               I tick and turn over time in the palm of my mind 
                <br>
               The texture of time against my skin is sticky and wet 
                <br>
               When all youâ€™ve got is time life is a 
               mess 
                <br>
               I can feel the imminence of time dripping down my neck 
                <br>
               Time wasted waiting for a moment of rest 
               Three hands of a clock all pointing left 
               It must be a sign 
                <br>
               The clock must confess 
               Time is a trick
               And life, a test
               </p>
