            <p id= "response"> Since, this was written so long ago it is interesting to ponder what Debord's opinion of the Internet World would be. I think the Internet has amplified "the spectacle" in a lot of ways, but it is also a place where the social hierarchy is more leveled out. The amount of free knowledge on the internet is something that brings more equity into the social structure. I think Debord would regard the Internet as another thing that brings people away from their reality and controls their gaze. Yet, personally I think the internet creates a new reality that really mirrors our own. The Spectacle exists even more vastly on the Internet, as does just about everything. What has changed most I think is the execution of advertisements. Companies looking to advertise now have access to endless amounts of data on people, which allows them to target parts of society even more closely. I think the collection of online data has allowed the Spectacle to become more powerful. I don't know if this is necessarily a bad thing though because all of the good parts about the internet outweigh this. I think that since Debord originally wrote about the Spectacle people have adapted to it. I personally have gotten so good at ignoring things like ads and not letting them have an affect on me. Most people have some awareness of what Debord calls the spectacle and having awareness of what the spectacle aims to do gives it less power.</p>
