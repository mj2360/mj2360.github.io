                it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all
                consciousness."</p>
            <p class= quote>"But the  <a href="spectacle-3.html">spectacle</a> is nothing
                other than the sense of the total practice of a social-economic
                formation, its use of time."</p>
            <p class= quote>"Separated from his product, man himself produces all the details of
                    his world with ever increasing power, and thus finds himself ever more
                    separated from his world."</p>
            <p class= quote>"the most abstract, the most mystified
                sense (vision) corresponds to the generalized abstraction of present-day
                society."</p>
            <p class= quote>"The fetishistic, purely objective appearance of  <a href="spectacle-3.html">spectacular</a>

                classes"</p>
            <p class= quote>"The <a href="spectacle-3.html">spectacle</a> originates in the loss of the unity of the world, and
                the gigantic expansion of the modern <a href="spectacle-3.html">spectacle</a> expresses the totality
                of this loss"</p>
